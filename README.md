# Gradient Descent in Weight Space Is Kernel Descent in Activity Space

A short paper showing that gradient descent on network weights induces **kernel descent** in the space of neural activities, governed by a neural-tangent-kernel-style Gram matrix on internal neurons.

**Key result:** When the kernel is diagonally dominant (wide networks), each neuron's activity change is approximately proportional to the negative loss gradient with respect to that neuron's activity — converting untestable claims about synaptic learning rules into testable predictions about observable activity changes.
